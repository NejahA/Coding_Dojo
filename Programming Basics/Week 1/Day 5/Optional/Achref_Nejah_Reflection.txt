I have become familiar with different programming concepts :
such as data types, variables, operators, arrays, conditinals and for loops.


I learned that learning comes through struggle that induces a healthy challenge to the brain
without provoking too much stress that blocks learning.


One valuable mistake i made this week is not uploading the assingnments correctly to gethub.
Now I manage to update my repository without problem.
